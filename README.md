## About me
Grew up in Cape Town, South Africa during a very exciting transition period which I can attribute my zero tolerance of bigotry and racism to. Moved to Dublin, Ireland in 2001 to pursue work and/or College. Worked for an Irish Bank doing tech support before attending Dublin City University to get a BSc. in Multimedia. Met my (future) wife while working in an Irish Pub. We decided to move to America in 2010 (sheâ€™s an American ;) and got married. Now the happy father of one energetic 3 year old toddler

I've always liked tech, and was drawn to web design early as it was a fun nexus of code/tech and design. logic and creativity clashing. Now days I'm still enthusiastic about web design, just a little business focused. I'm currently expanding my interests to NLP, Chatbots and AR
